# Efficient CNN-Based Bone Fracture Detection in X-Ray Radiographs with MobileNetV2
Abstract: In this study, a deep learning-based approach for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images, utilizing a MobileNetV2 architecture combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Fractures are a prevalent musculoskeletal injury demanding swift and accurate diagnosis for optimal treatment. Our system leverages the Bone Fracture Dataset to train the model in identifying and classifying fractures across diverse anatomical regions. The integration of MobileNetV2, known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, with CNNs, allowed us to achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. In its best performance, the system achieved a success rate of 94.8% on the practice data it was trained on. When tested on entirely new data, it was still able to identify fractures correctly in 93.5% of the cases, demonstrating its efficacy in accurately detecting bone fractures. This approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also reduces the time and effort required for manual evaluation. By automating the initial detection phase, the system endeavors to minimize diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes, offering a reliable and rapid assessment tool for healthcare professionals.<br>

In the rapidly advancing field of medical imaging, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning technologies is transforming how healthcare professionals diagnose conditions and treat patients. The study presented demonstrates a clear pathway toward enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of bone fracture detection through a sophisticated model utilizing MobileNetV2 and CNNs. This combination not only showcases the potential of AI in improving diagnostic workflows but also addresses crucial gaps in the traditional methods of manual X-ray analysis.

The results of achieving over 93% accuracy on both training and testing datasets underscore the robustness of the model. The methodology employed, including the use of transfer learning and data augmentation, contributes significantly to the model‚Äôs performance. Transfer learning allows the model to leverage pre-trained features from a vast dataset (ImageNet) while data augmentation enhances the training set‚Äôs diversity, making it more representative of real-world scenarios.

The necessity for quick and reliable diagnosis in urgent medical situations cannot be overstated. Bone fractures, being one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries, require immediate attention to initiate appropriate treatment. Current practices often rely on the expertise of radiologists, which, while valuable, can be prone to human error and may lead to delays in care. By automating the detection process, the proposed system aims to minimize such risks, providing healthcare professionals with a reliable tool that can assist in the initial assessment of X-ray images.
